Docam
=====

Android camera app for papers.

All the math for the app is explained in my book called [Geometry for Programmers](https://www.manning.com/books/geometry-for-programmers).

Schedules, announcements, notes, book covers etc. Just use menu button to take a picture, and your touchscreen to mark a frame. Pictures will be stored in Docam folder.
